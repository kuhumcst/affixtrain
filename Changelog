Version 3.00 - 2015.08.13
-------------------------
Improved user interface, fewer files in temporary directory. Defaults
for some options changed. You need only provide a single option,
-i <full-form/lemma file>, whereafter affixtrain computes optimal
parameters for reducing the size of a trained tree (locally) maximally
for the provided training data. Then affixtrain validates the results
both with OOV and vocabulary words. Finally affixtrain produces
flexrule files using all training data.
In a separate run, using option -b, a flexrule file can be pretty printed
and converted to a Bracmat file (another text format). Optionally a list
of words can be lemmatised.
There is still some dead wood removal and code rationalizing to do.

Version 2.28 - 2015.08.06
-------------------------
"Zero-length" lemmas are excluded from proposed list of possible lemmas.  

Version 2.26 - 2015.07.16
-------------------------
Started changelog.
Current state of affixtrain:
1. Testing with training data gives zero incorrectly lemmatized words. This is
   as at always should have been, but it wasn't 100% the case until now.
2. Unlimited ambiguity is allowed. The first versions of affixtrain could
   handle at most two lemmas per word form. After introducing a new flexrule
   file format, this limitation is gone.
3. When running affixtrain, a parameter file is created that documents what
   was done. Any test results are added at the end. These results can help
   decide which pruning threshold (also called cutoff) is optimal for
   lemmatization of OOV words. (You probably want to use the optional
   dictionary if you choose to use pruned flexrules.)
